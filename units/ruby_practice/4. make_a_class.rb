# 1. Create a class called MyCar. 
	# When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, allow the user to define some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and model of the car. 
	# Create an instance variable that is set to 0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed of the car as well. 
	# Create instance methods that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.




# 2. Add an accessor method to your MyCar class to change and view the color of your car. 
	# Then add an accessor method that allows you to view, but not modify, the year of your car.




# 3. You want to create a nice interface that allows you to accurately describe the action you want your program to perform. 
	# Create a method called spray_paint that can be called on an object and will modify the color of the car.
