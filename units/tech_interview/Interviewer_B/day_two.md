* I'm creating a scoreboard on my game website, but I want the score to be displayed as tally marks. Write a function that translates the numeric score into tally marks. My tally mark font uses the letters a, b, c, d, e to represent tally marks for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively. Each group of five should be placed inside one index of an array. Assume that the score you receive will be an integer. This function should return an array that represents the correct score.
