## Quick Notes

Today, we are going to jump headfirst into whiteboarding. Remember: Be confident, friendly, and humble. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Your personal impression and your willingness to improve are oftentimes more important than your actual code quality.

This afternoon, you're going to be whiteboarding with a partner. One of you will be Interviewer A, the other will be Interviewer B. **Do not look at the other person's questions.** Depending on who you are, that's the question you'll deliver (e.g. Interviewer A will give their question to Interviewer B, and vice-versa).
