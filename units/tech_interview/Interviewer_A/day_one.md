## Questions

* Describe a challenge you've had at work. What was it, and how did you address it?

* We have an array, and we'd like to know if it contains any triples - that is, an integer that appears three times in a row. Write a function that returns `true` if the array contains a triple.

*Clarifying, if they ask: the array contains only integers. The array is not sorted. The array can contain any number of triples - return true if it contains at least one.*
