## Questions

* Do you ever postpone making a decision at work? If so, why?

* Design a function that can accept as an argument three different data types: A string, an integer, or an array. This function should return a boolean depending on whether its argument is symmetrical. For example, `121` is symmetrical, whereas `122` is not.
  - *Clarifying, if they ask: Strings and arrays can be empty, and empty strings/arrays are symmetrical.*

* Given an array of numbers, reset the array to put all the non-zero numbers in front of all the zeros in the array. Then return the new array and the count of non-zero numbers.
  - *If they ask: The new array and the count can be contained inside a larger array. They would be the 0th and 1st indices.*
