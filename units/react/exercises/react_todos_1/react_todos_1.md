# React Todos 1 - Exercises

## Dynamic Select

* Create Aatext input form with an `add` button.
* Create a select element that will be empty initially. When the user submits some text from the input, add this text as an option to the select.
* Create a `submit` button. This button will be disabled as long as the user had not selected a value from the select (to select a value, the user will need to add it first).
* When the submit is not disabled and the user clicks on it. Display the following text below the select: `"You selected"` followed by the selected value.
