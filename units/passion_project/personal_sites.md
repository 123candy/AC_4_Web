So, personal sites are cool. But how do we make them? What's the best way? Here's an overview of a few strategies, alongside a few interesting tools to help you build a great looking site.

## Strategy 1: React and Netlify

Remember [this one](https://github.com/C4Q/AC_4_Web/blob/master/units/react/projects/deploy/deploy.md)? Netlify and React are still great choices for hosting a static site. All you have to do is nail the CSS, and this strategy will turn out great.

**Advantages**
* Easy: It's what we've been using.
* Fast: React loads everything in advance, so switching between pages is a breeze.

**Disadvantages**
* Opportunity: If you want to learn about other ways to deploy content on the Internet, this won't do.

## Strategy 2: HTML/CSS and S3/Firebase

Who needs JavaScript, anyways? [I sure didn't.](https://reedgaines.com/index.html). Using Firebase or S3 might be a little more involved, but it gives you the opportunity to explore how these platforms work. That's some resume-building stuff, guys.

The step-by-step instructions found above both work well.

**Advantages**
* Why use what you don't need? HTML/CSS is minimalist.
* Get experience using cutting-edge cloud storage platforms.

**Disadvantages**
* Not a single-page app: Each page has to load individually.
* Slightly more difficult than React/Netlify, if only because we aren't as familiar with this stuff.
