# Project: Basic ​Calculator

Use the following files as a starting point for a basic calculator web app:

* [html](assets/calc.html)
* [css](assets/calc.css)
* [js](assets/calc.js)

* Edit the files so that when the user click on one of the operator buttons  (`+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`) keys, the operator is displayed on the calculator.

* Edit the project so that clicking on an operator when one has just been clicked will do nothing.

* Edit the project so that when the user clicks on the `=` button, the result of the calculation is displayed.

* Edit​ ​​ _calc.js_ ​​​so​ ​that​ ​the​ `​C`​ ​button​ ​clears​ ​the​ ​text​ ​of​ ​​outputDiv​.

* Edit​ ​​ _calc.css_ ​​​so​ ​that​ ​the​ ​page​ ​uses​ ​a​ ​calculator-specific​ ​font​ ​like​ ​​Orbitron​.

* Edit​ ​​ _calc.css_ ​ ​​so​ ​that​ ​the​ ​text​ ​of​ ​​outputDiv​​ ​is​ ​right-aligned.

* Generate​ ​a​ ​​favicon​​ ​and​ ​link​ ​to​ ​it​ ​from​ ​​ _calc.html_.
