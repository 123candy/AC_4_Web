# Parentheses

## Lesson

Parentheses are often used in mathemtaics to change the order of operations. For example, if we want to multiply the sum of two numbers:

```js
> (2 + 3) * 5
25
```

In javascript, parentheses work the same way for numbers. We can also use parentheses to change the order in which other operators are applied.
