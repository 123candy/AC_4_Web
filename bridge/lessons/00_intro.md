## Logic Puzzles

### Hats

Cannibals ambush a safari in the jungle and capture three people. The cannibals give the people men a single chance to escape uneaten.

The captives are lined up in order of height, and are tied to stakes. The person in the rear can see the backs of his two friends, the person in the middle can see the back of the person in front, and the person in front cannot see anyone. The cannibals show the men five hats. Three of the hats are black and two of the hats are white.

Blindfolds are then placed over each man's eyes and a hat is placed on each person's head. The two hats left over are hidden. The blindfolds are then removed and it is said to the people that if one of them can guess what color hat he is wearing they can all leave unharmed.

The person in the rear who can see both of his friends' hats but not his own says, "I don't know". The middle one (who can see the hat of the person in front), says "I don't know". The front person who cannot see ANYBODY'S hat says "I know!".

How did he know the color of his hat and what color was it?

### Lies or Truth

You are at an unmarked intersection. One way is the City of Lies and another way is the City of Truth.

Citizens of the City of Lies always lie.

Citizens of the City of Truth always tell the truth.

There are two citizens at the intersection. You know one of the is from the City of Lies and the other is from the City Of Truth. Unfortunately, you don't know which is which. You can only ask one of them a single question. What question could you ask to find the way to the City of Truth?

### Crates of Fruit

You work at a fruit factory.

There are 3 crates in front of you. One crate contains only apples. One crate contains only oranges. The other crate contains both apples and oranges.

And each crate is labeled. One reads "apples", one reads "oranges", and one reads "apples and oranges".

But the labeling machine has gone crazy and is now labeling all boxes incorrectly.

If you can only take out and look at just one of the pieces of fruit from just one of the crates, how can you label ALL of the crates correctly?
